                <p>ISKCON belongs to the <b>Gaudiya-Vaishnava Sampradāya</b>, a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts <b>Bhagavad-gītā</b> and the <b>Bhagavat Purana,</b> or <b>Srimad Bhagavatam</b>. These are the historic texts of the devotional bhakti yoga tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to <b>reawaken their love for God</b>, or Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”.</p>

<p>God is known across the world by many names including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama, etc. ISKCON devotees chant God’s names in the form of the maha-mantra, or the great prayer for deliverance:</p>

<p><i>Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</i></p>

                Many leading academics have highlighted ISKCON’s authenticity. Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University, describes the movement as “a tradition that commands a respected place in the religious life of humankind”. In the 1980s Dr. A. L. Basham, one of the world’s authorities on Indian history and culture, wrote of ISKCON that,<b> “It arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty years and has become known all over the West. This, I feel, is a sign of the times and an important fact in the history of the Western world”.</b>

                <p>Sri Caitanya, whom devotees recognize as a direct incarnation of Krishna, gave a powerful impetus for a massive bhakti (devotional) movement throughout India. Under his direction hundreds of volumes on the philosophy of Krishna Consciousness were compiled.</p>
