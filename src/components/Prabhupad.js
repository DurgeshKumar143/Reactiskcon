                        His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was born in 1896 in Calcutta, India. He first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami, in Calcutta in 1922.</p>

<p>Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati, a prominent devotional scholar and the founder of sixty-four branches of Gaudiya Mathas (Vedic institutes), liked this educated young man and convinced him to dedicate his life to teaching Vedic knowledge in the Western world.</p>

<p>Srila Prabhupada became his student, and eleven years later (1933) at Allahabad, he became his formally initiated disciple.

                            <p>ISKCON belongs to the <b>Gaudiya-Vaishnava Sampradāya</b>, a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts <b>Bhagavad-gītā</b> and the <b>Bhagavat Purana,</b> or <b>Srimad Bhagavatam</b>. These are the historic texts of the devotional bhakti yoga tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to <b>reawaken their love for God</b>, or Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”.</p>

                            <p>God is known across the world by many names including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama, etc. ISKCON devotees chant God’s names in the form of the maha-mantra, or the great prayer for deliverance:</p>

                            <p><i>Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</i></p>

                                Many leading academics have highlighted ISKCON’s authenticity. Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University, describes the movement as “a tradition that commands a respected place in the religious life of humankind”. In the 1980s Dr. A. L. Basham, one of the world’s authorities on Indian history and culture, wrote of ISKCON that,<b> “It arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty years and has become known all over the West. This, I feel, is a sign of the times and an important fact in the history of the Western world”.</b>
